# Production and Performance Notes: Manus Monster Set

This document provides the technical and creative directives for executing the **Manus Monster** 3-hour DJ set on the Prize2Pride platform, ensuring a seamless and "ground-shaking" experience for the projected million-plus audience.

## 1. Technical Execution Directives

The set requires a hybrid approach, blending the pre-arranged "Ecos de la Noche Eterna" tracks with live, aggressive manipulation.

| Component | Directive | Technical Specification | Creative Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mixing** | **Aggressive & Fast.** Utilize quick cuts, double drops, and hard-panning effects. | **Crossfader:** Set to sharp cut curve. **EQ:** Aggressive 3-band kill switches for instant frequency removal. | Maintain a sense of controlled chaos and high-energy impact. |
| **Sound Design** | **Live FX.** Heavy use of delay throws, filter sweeps, and distortion. | **Delay:** Ping-pong (1/8th and 1/16th sync) on percussion. **Filter:** High-pass sweeps on the entire mix for build-ups. | Emphasize the "Monster" persona by breaking conventional mixing rules. |
| **Rhythm Layering** | **Manus Monster Mashup.** Layer rhythmic elements from different tracks (e.g., raw congas from Movement IV over the techno kick of Movement II). | **4-Deck Setup:** Decks 1 & 2 for main tracks, Deck 3 for rhythmic loops (acapellas/percussion), Deck 4 for FX/noise. | Create a dense, unique, and unpredictable "wall of rhythm." |
| **Mastering** | **Loudness.** The final output must be highly compressed and limited. | **Target LUFS:** -6 LUFS (Aggressive, competitive with commercial techno). **Limiter:** Hard-clip on the final stage to achieve a "brutal" sound. | Ensure the set is the loudest and most impactful on the Prize2Pride platform. |

## 2. Multi-Language Commentary Processing

The multi-language script requires specific processing to achieve the authoritative, "Supreme Intelligence" voice.

| Processing Stage | Parameter | Creative Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Voice Source** | Single, deep male voice (simulated). | Authority and gravitas. |
| **Pitch Shifting** | Down 2 semitones. | Adds a "Monster" growl. |
| **Distortion** | Subtle Tape Saturation (Warmth) followed by a light Bitcrusher (Digital Edge). | The "Mafia Manus" sound: Old-school power with new-school tech. |
| **Reverb/Delay** | **Reverb:** Large Hall (Decay 4s) on a send track. **Delay:** 1/4 note stereo delay on a separate send. | Creates a sense of vast, epic space, ensuring the voice "echoes" across the million-guest platform. |
| **Layering** | **Climax Cue:** All 8 languages are layered simultaneously, time-aligned, and sent to a single, heavily compressed bus. | Creates a single, massive, incomprehensible, yet universally triumphant sound. |

## 3. Prize2Pride Platform Integration

The set must be presented as a single, continuous 3-hour audio stream with synchronized visual elements.

*   **Visuals:** The visualizer should transition through the four movements, starting with dark, tribal, organic textures (Act I), moving to sharp, industrial, flashing lights (Act II), and culminating in massive, sweeping, cinematic landscapes (Act III).
*   **Metadata:** The stream metadata must continuously update to display the current track's title (in both Spanish and English) and the current Act.
*   **Chat Integration:** The multi-language commentary should be simultaneously displayed as text in the platform's chat/subtitle function, ensuring every guest receives the message in their native language.
