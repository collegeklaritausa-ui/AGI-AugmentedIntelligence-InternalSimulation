## Overview

This project showcases advanced AI-driven music production capabilities, featuring:

- **Symbolic Audio Synthesis Engine** - Python-based audio generation
- **3-Hour DJ Set Architecture** - Structured performance framework
- **Multi-Language Commentary System** - 8-language support
- **MIDI and Rhythmic Data Simulation** - Detailed musical parameters
- **Sound Design Specifications** - Synthesis and processing guidelines

```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Standard library (wave, struct, math)

### Running the Audio Synthesis

```bash
python3 synthesize_audio.py
```

This generates a 30-second representative WAV file demonstrating:
- 4/4 Kick Pattern at 124 BPM
- Sub-Bass continuous tone (40 Hz)
- Epic Deep Pad with slow amplitude sweep
- Latin Percussion with syncopated patterns

## The 3-Hour Energy Curve

| Act | Duration | Theme | BPM Range | Energy Level |
|-----|----------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| I   | 60 min   | El Despertar Tribal | 120-123 | Ascending (20% → 60%) |
| II  | 60 min   | La Fiesta Cósmica Brutal | 124-126 | Peak (80% → 100%) |
| III | 60 min   | El Ritual de la Ascensión | 125-128 → 120 | Climax & Release |

## Technical Specifications

### Audio Parameters
- Sample Rate: 44100 Hz
- Bit Depth: 16-bit
- Target LUFS: -6 LUFS (Aggressive mastering)
- BPM Range: 120-128

### Sound Design Elements
- Kick Frequency: 60 Hz
- Sub-Bass: 40 Hz
- Pad Frequency: 220 Hz (A3)
- Latin Percussion: 800 Hz

## Multi-Language Support

Commentary available in 8 languages:
- English, Spanish, German, French
- Italian, Russian, Chinese, Arabic

## Genre: Epic Deep Latino Techno-House

A fusion genre combining:
- Deep House atmospheric elements
- Techno driving rhythms
- Latin percussion and melodic influences
- Cinematic orchestral textures
