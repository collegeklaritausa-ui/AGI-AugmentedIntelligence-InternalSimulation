# Album Concept: Ecos de la Noche Eterna (Echoes of the Eternal Night)

The **"Ecos de la Noche Eterna"** project is a 20-track journey through the sonic landscape of **Epic Deep Latino Techno-House**. The album is structured into four distinct movements, each exploring a different facet of the genre, from the introspective depths of deep house to the driving energy of peak-time techno, all unified by a rich tapestry of Latin American rhythms and instrumentation.
